# Sure, here’s a simple example of rasterization rendering in Python using the Pygame library. This example will render a triangle.
#
# Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world rasterization involves many more complex steps like z-buffering, shading, etc.

import pygame
import pygame.gfxdraw

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up some constants
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 640, 480
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

# Define the vertices of the triangle
vertices = [(320, 100), (230, 380), (410, 380)]

# Draw the triangle
pygame.gfxdraw.filled_polygon(screen, vertices, WHITE)
pygame.gfxdraw.aapolygon(screen, vertices, WHITE)

# Update the display
pygame.display.flip()

# Wait for user to close window
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

pygame.quit()

# In this code:
#
# We first initialize Pygame and set up a display window.
# We define the vertices of a triangle.
# We use pygame.gfxdraw.filled_polygon to draw a filled triangle (rasterize the triangle), and pygame.gfxdraw.aapolygon to draw the anti-aliased outline of the triangle.
# We then enter a loop where we wait for the user to close the window.
# Please note that you’ll need to install Pygame using pip if you haven’t already done so. You can install it with pip install pygame. Also note that this code does not handle any error checking or validation. You would need to add that for a production-ready solution.
